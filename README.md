# Welcome to Project P!

This repository is meant to record all of the problems tackled by Project P @ UGA, and their solutions.

**What is Project P?**<br>
We're a group of students broadly interested in solving toy problems in the computer science + math space. These problems generally include (but are far from limited to):

• LeetCode: A wide range of problems that involve utilizing various computer science data structures and algorithms.<br>
• Project Euler: More mathematically-challenging problems that are often solved by coding out a particular mathematical approach.<br>
• Code Golf: Problem-solving with the goal of minimizing the number of characters in the source code

**How do I contribute?**<br>
If you're a member of Project P, and have a solution you'd like to contribute, you can [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your solution!
